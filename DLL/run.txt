1. First create the B1.java file 
    >write the java code


2. in the terminal run the following command
    >javac -h . B1.java
        this command create the file B1.h // do not modify the file
    

3. Now create the B1.c file
    > Inside this we'll write the calculator code

4. Now it's time to add the path to the JAVA_HOME
    >echo $JAVA_HOME
        this will show nothing for first time
    
    >ls /usr/lib/jvm 
        This will show the jdk folder where the java is installed
    
    >export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk-arm64 
            in the last the you need to specify the installed version of your java
    
    >echo $JAVA_HOME
        this will show the path of our JAVA_HOME

5.Now it's time to compile the C file we created which is B1.C

    >gcc -fPIC -I"$JAVA_HOME/include" -I"$JAVA_HOME/include/linux" -shared -o libB1.so B1.c


6. Now run the java file
    >java -Djava.library.path= . B1
