# Guides

This file contains guides that were used for making the script and other references.

- [Main doc](https://learn.adafruit.com/dht-humidity-sensing-on-raspberry-pi-with-gdocs-logging/python-setup)
- [Setting up Pi for CircuitPython Libraries](https://learn.adafruit.com/circuitpython-on-raspberrypi-linux/installing-circuitpython-on-raspberry-pi)
- [AdaFruit CircuitPython Bundles](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle)
- [AdaFruit CircutPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython)

I have referred these guides and created a script which automates the process of creating a python virtual environment and installing all the required dependencies.
